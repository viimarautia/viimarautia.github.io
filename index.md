## Introduction

Greetings, visitor! I am Mortimer Mamelukkikala, a made up person for the Final Assignment of the Command line tools for linguists course in the University of Helsinki.
Much like my creator, I also go to a university. I'm a second-year student in the Fish University of Malm√∂, where I am majoring in undersea gardening.

Outside of studying and tending to my rock wrack garden, my days are usually spent swimming and scavenging the sea floor for nutrients.
Sometimes I like to break my routine and take a short walk on the beach and simply observe people.
I'm also a huge fan of squash and visit a friend every week to catch a game on their high-definition TV.
